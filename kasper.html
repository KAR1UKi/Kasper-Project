            <h2>EAGLE</h2>
            <p>An eagle is a large bird of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae. Eagles are known for their impressive size, powerful build, keen eyesight, and strong beaks and talons. They are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain in their ecosystems. Eagles are characterized by their broad wings and soaring flight, which allows them to cover vast distances while searching for prey. They typically feed on small mammals, birds, fish, and sometimes carrion. Eagles are found on every continent except Antarctica, and they hold significant cultural and symbolic importance in many societies around the world..</p>

            <img src="gg%20image.jpg" alt="Placeholder Image">
            <p>"Man" typically refers to an adult human male. However, in a broader sense, "man" can refer to humanity as a whole, encompassing both men and women. In many contexts, "man" has been used historically as a generic term for humankind. It's important to note that the term "man" has been criticized for its gender-specific connotations, and alternative language such as "people" or "humans" is often used to be more inclusive.
